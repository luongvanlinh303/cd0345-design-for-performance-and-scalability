- Instance Type: The performance can be reduced due to small resources. However, we still can scale
if we want to. (from t2.xlarge to t2.large ($898.5 -> $479.75)
- Model Pricing: Reserving instances for 1 year will reduce cost for the architecture. However, we lock the application
platform to use the same infrastructure for one year. Nevertheless, more resources can be added due
to elasticity. (from on-demand to standard)
- Scale Down RDS Instance: We will have performance issues in the database because reducing the computational capacity. But, it can be bearable.
