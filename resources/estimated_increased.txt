- Scale Out the ec2 instance and load balancer: Provide high availability for the application due to more computational capacity when changing for
larger instance type. Even if Northern Virginia region is completely down, application will be up and running in Oregon Region.
- Add RDS database instances in Oregon Region: In order to reduce latency for end users when accessing the application, we add database replicas. For example, Read Replica can be in the Oregon region.
Allow you to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for
read-heavy database workloads.
- Add resources to RDS: Improve database performance because provides a cost-effective way to increase storage capacity and would be useful in case of huge traffic on the application.
Resource upgrades are generally easy to implement and manage.
